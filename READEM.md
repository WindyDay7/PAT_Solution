## About the the compile

I used the VScode and MINGW to compile the code, 

what I do just configure the compile file, and when you want to change the compile file , you could just change the `task.json` and  `lanuch.json` file.

so I write some problem in one file, what you write in `lanuch.json` just like a makefile.
